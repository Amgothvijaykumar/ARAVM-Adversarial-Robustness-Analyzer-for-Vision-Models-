# GAMMA AI PROMPT - Copy and Paste Directly

---

## PROMPT FOR GAMMA AI:

```
Create a 10-slide professional hackathon presentation for "ARAVM - Adversarial Robustness Analyzer for Vision Models"

Theme: Dark mode, cybersecurity aesthetic with blue/purple gradient

SLIDE 1 - TITLE:
Title: ARAVM - Adversarial Robustness Analyzer for Vision Models
Subtitle: Securing AI Vision Systems Before Attackers Strike
Team: Vijay (Lead), Yash, Shruthi, Tharun, Vamc

SLIDE 2 - THE PROBLEM:
Heading: Can You Trust Your AI?
Content: AI vision systems powering self-driving cars, face recognition, and medical imaging are vulnerable to INVISIBLE attacks. A tiny 1% pixel change can fool AI completely. 97% of AI models tested are vulnerable. Real consequences: accidents, security breaches, wrong diagnoses.
Visual: Split image showing normal vs attacked image

SLIDE 3 - WHY IT MATTERS:
Heading: Real-World Impact
Content: Autonomous vehicles misread signs → Accidents. Face unlock bypassed → Fraud. Medical AI fooled → Wrong treatment. Security cameras evaded → Crime. The gap: Organizations deploy AI without security testing.
Visual: Industry icons with risk indicators

SLIDE 4 - OUR SOLUTION:
Heading: Introducing ARAVM
Content: A comprehensive security auditing toolkit that tests AI models BEFORE deployment. Four attack levels: White-box (FGSM, PGD), Black-box, Patch attacks (ROA), Defense testing. Outputs: Visual dashboard, heatmaps, HTML security report.
Visual: ARAVM logo with shield, toolkit icons

SLIDE 5 - WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:
Heading: Why ARAVM Stands Out
Content: Integrated 3 libraries (IBM ART + Captum + phattacks). Live face recognition demo with real-time attacks. Adjustable noise slider for granular testing. Professional HTML reports. Multiple attack types in one tool. Defense effectiveness testing.
Visual: Comparison checkmarks

SLIDE 6 - SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
Heading: How It Works
Content: Input (Image/Webcam) → ARAVM Core Engine (Level 1: FGSM/PGD, Level 2: HopSkipJump, Level 3: ROA Patches, Level 4: Defenses) → Metrics Engine (MR, L2, L∞) → Output (Dashboard, Heatmaps, HTML Report)
Visual: Flow diagram with colored levels

SLIDE 7 - TEAM & TECH STACK:
Heading: Our Team & Technology
Content: Vijay - Architecture & Integration. Yash - Attack Implementation. Shruthi - Testing & Validation. Tharun - Visualization & Reports. Vamc - Research & Defense Analysis. Tech: Python, PyTorch, IBM ART, OpenCV, Captum
Visual: Team roles with tech stack icons

SLIDE 8 - WORKING DEMO RESULTS:
Heading: Proof It Works
Content: Image Attack: ResNet50 tested - 100% attack success rate with only 3% pixel change (invisible to humans). Face Attack: SFace recognition fooled - confidence drops from 0.85 to 0.25 (Unknown) with noise attack. All defenses tested (JPEG, smoothing) failed to protect.
Visual: Before/after screenshots, metrics dashboard

SLIDE 9 - IMPACT & FUTURE SCOPE:
Heading: Impact & What's Next
Content: Impact: Protect autonomous vehicles, banking face recognition, healthcare AI, government surveillance. Future: Add more attacks (C&W, DeepFool), cloud API deployment, automated remediation, MLOps integration, mobile field testing app.
Visual: Industry icons, roadmap timeline

SLIDE 10 - CONCLUSION:
Heading: Secure AI Before It's Too Late
Content: Problem: AI is vulnerable to invisible attacks. Solution: ARAVM provides complete security testing. Proof: 100% attack success on production models. Impact: Protect critical AI across all industries. Call to action: Test your AI with ARAVM today!
